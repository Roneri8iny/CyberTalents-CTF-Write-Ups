## Cypher Anxiety Write-Up

### First Look:

After opening the challenge, we find the description as follows:

> An image was leaked from a babies store. the manager is so annoyed because he needs to identify the image to fire charges against the responsible employee. the key is the md5 of the image.
 
We see that we are given a zip file. After we download that file and extract its content, we find that there is a file in it called "find the image.pcap".
