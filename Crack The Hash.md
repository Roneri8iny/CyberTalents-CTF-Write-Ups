### The hash that we were given : 1ab566b9fa5c0297295743e7c2a6ec27

First, we can try getting to know the type of the hash in order to be able to crack it.
We use the website "Hash Analyzer" to do this.

We got the result that it is MD5 or MD4 

So, let us try to look  for a website that cracks MD5 hashes since they are weak hashes.

We can use any website to do this, I used MD5Online to do this and got the following output:

> Found :Â **Iamtheflag**  
(hash = 1ab566b9fa5c0297295743e7c2a6ec27)

There, fore we have found the flag.
