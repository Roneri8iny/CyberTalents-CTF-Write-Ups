# Cyber Talents - RSA101 Writeup

When we first open the challenge, the description tells us that they recieved  a message from their agent but they don't know how to use the key to read the message 

So let's download the file on kali and see what we can do.
First run the following command in the terminal to download the file by `wget` command.

Then extract the files , after that we can see that their is a cipher file and a key.

Now we can run this command in the Terminal
```Termainl
openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -in cipher -out flag.txt -inkeyÂ  key.pem
```

The output is put in an flag.txt file so let's cat in the terminal.

```Terminal
cat flag.txt
```

The flag is right in the file.
