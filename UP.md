#  *UP Write-Up*

After opening the challenge we find the following description:

> Every time you go up you will gain one ballon
> ejxc{T0nY0J_BsUMS4}

The first part by intuition "ejxc" means "flag" , so we can conclude that:

> e maps onto f   : e is 0 letters away from f
>
> j maps onto l   : j is 1 letter away from l
> 
> x maps onto a : x is 2 letter away from a
> 
> c maps onto g : c is 3 letter away from g

And this goes on with the rest of the letters:

> T is 4 letter away from Y
> 
> n is 5 letter away from u
> 
> Y is 6 letter away from G
> 
> J is 7 letter away from T
> 
> M is 8 letter away from B
> 
> s is 9 letter away from e
> 
> U is 10 letter away from H
> 
> M is 11 letter away from A
> 
> S is 12 letter away from H

Thus we got the flag.
