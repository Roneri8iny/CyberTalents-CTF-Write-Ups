# Cyber Talents - Louder Writeup

First when we open the challenge page the description tells us that there is a wired sound and it is encoded 
so he wants us to decode it some how 

So let's begin with downloading the sound file and open it.

After hearing the sound yoou can notice that it is a morse code.

>Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two 
different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs.

So now we can search for a web site that can decode that audio 

I used this website:
https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html

You can now upload the file and wait for the flag to appear.
